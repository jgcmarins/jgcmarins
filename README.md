Hi, I'm Joao! ðŸ‘‹

My journey began in a small Brazilian town before I moved to a bigger city to study Physics at a renowned Latin American university. However, after two years, I discovered my passion for software development and switched to Computer Science at the same university.

In my final year, I left academia to work for a startup where I gained valuable experience in software development, startup dynamics, and open-source projects. During this time, I found my identity as a Full Stack Engineer.

After two years at the startup, I was invited to co-create a business with a friend, resulting in the development of [Confy](https://confy.app/) and [Angora](https://angoralabs.com/). Eventually, our paths diverged, and I pursued new opportunities.

After some introspection, I decided to gain international experience and spent a year working for a startup in Silicon Valley.

In my most recent role, I worked as a CTO at [bem.te.vi](https://www.bemtevi.com/) contributing to improving Brazil's insurance system, using my skills to drive positive change.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and maintaining my health through CrossFit.

I am currently exploring new career opportunities.
